# processing script
#
#this script loads the raw data, processes and cleans it 
#and saves it as Rds file in the processed_data folder

#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.
library(readxl) #for loading Excel files
library(dplyr) #for data processing
library(here) #to set paths

#path to data
#note the use of the here() package and not absolute paths
data_location <- here::here("data","raw_data","Covid Vaccine data_Bangladesh_Abu_Sayeed.xlsx")
 

#but it adds typing. You can do it either way.
rawdata <- readxl::read_excel(data_location)


processeddata <- rawdata
                     



# save data as RDS
# I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. 
# This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. 
# If you save as CSV, that information would get lost.
# See here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:
# http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata

# location to save file
save_data_location <- here::here("data","processed_data","processeddata.rds")

saveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)
