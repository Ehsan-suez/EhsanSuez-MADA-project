1. "processing_code" contains my "processingscript.Rmd" that I used to process the raw data. You can knit it.
2. "analysis_code" contains my "exploratoryscript.Rmd" which I initially used to do some exploratory analysis.
3. "analysis_code" also contains my "analysisscript.Rmd" which I ran to do analysis. That is also the task for Part3 of the project. This Rmd file will continue to grow as I keep doing more advanced analysis in next few days.
