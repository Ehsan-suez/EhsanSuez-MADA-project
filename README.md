Welcome, Dr. Handel! 
This is my MADA my project github.

1. The processing was done using "processingscript.Rmd" that you can find under "processing_code" folder.
2. The exploratory analysis was done using "exploratory.Rmd" that you can find under "analysis_code" folder.
3. The initial analysis (part 3) was done using "analysisscript.Rmd" that you can find under "analysis_code".
4. The final product is the "manuscript.Rmd"". You can also see another file named "supplementary.Rmd" where I have put all the supplementary results. Both Rmd file can be found under the "PRoduct" folder. And if you knit them, both can reproduce results.
